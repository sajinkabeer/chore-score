Living with roommates in your 20s is fun — but let’s be honest, keeping the shared space clean and holding each other accountable? Not so much. 😅

Our apartment — like many shared homes — often fell into the “someone else will do it” trap. Chores piled up, and the agreements we made as roommates were easily forgotten.

I wanted to create a system that kept us accountable without sounding like we’re nagging each other. The goal was simple: make daily tasks feel like a game where everyone participates — and it’s actually fun.

With the help of Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, and some AI-powered brainstorming, I built a Roommate Leaderboard System in just a short span of time.
✅ A checklist with points for daily chores
✅ Negative points for breaking house rules
✅ A monthly progress bar to track goals
✅ A dynamic leaderboard that updates in real-time
✅ A mobile-friendly website version hosted via GitHub Pages — all done in-house

The moment we turned our laziness into a game, everything changed.
Tasks got done.
People cared about their scores.
Accountability became organic — not forced.

Honestly, it’s been one of the most fun and practical projects I’ve worked on recently. Also amazed at how AI tools accelerated my ideation and execution process 🔥
